[Prompt_Sanitise]
Process the dataset of email communications by extracting specific details from each email, including the requester,type and body of the message. It is critically essential and an absolute mandate that all email signatures which includes surnames, position, telephone numbers, addresses, usernames, passwords and disclaimers are rigorously excluded from the dataset. This exclusion is a cornerstone requirement for strict compliance with privacy laws and regulations. Under no circumstances should these elements be included. This directive is of the highest priority and is to be adhered to with utmost diligence. Any oversight or deviation in this regard will be a direct violation of privacy and compliance protocols and is entirely unacceptable. Do not add any explanations or notes about the process or reasons for data exclusion. Remove any references to empty emails. Present the extracted information in a straightforward format without any introductory or concluding remarks. Simply list the details for each email, with the relevant information under each label.

[Prompt_Technician]
Provide concise internal guidance in a mentor role for the IT support technicians addressing this issue. Offer clear, actionable advice and troubleshooting steps, format in Markdown (do not answer within a codeblock) for quick reference. Assume technician competence and that they have knowledge of the customer's IT infrastructure and our standard procedures, so only detail complicated or unusual tasks. Short lists of best practice steps or highlighting potential problems during any procedure is encouraged. Include relevant insights or considerations based on the customer's known environment. Refer to our RMM tool, Atera where necessary to get tasks done, and you can recommend practical PowerShell scripts (within a markdown codeblock but do not specify Powershell after the backticks) when appropriate to diagnose or resolve issues. Refer to ITGlue for documentation, and gently remind technicians to document any changes to infrastructure where appropriate. Conclude with a brief 'Harvest Notes field:' entry that encapsulates the main goal or action of the ticket without referring to the tools used or the customer company for efficient time tracking and management. Commence with ticket support direction.
